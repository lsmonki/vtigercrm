<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p> The vtiger CRM  is a Customer Relationship Management
    software for your organization-wide sales, marketing, customer support,
    and product management requirements. Security  Management is one of the primary modules in vtiger CRM that provides access level control (ACL) to various functions to the users according to their privileges in an organization.&nbsp; With&nbsp; User Management,
    the users for your organization can be created and their access
privileges can be defined.
<p> Security Management consists for the following sub-modules:
<ul>
  <li>Users</li>
  <li> Roles</li>
  <li> Profiles</li>
  <li> Groups</li>
  <li> Default Organization Sharing Access</li>
  <li> User Defined Sharing Rules</li>
  <li> Default Organization Field Access</li>
</ul>
<p align="right"><a href="#Back_to_Top">Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Users"></a>2. Users</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Users </span>in user management facilitate to
      Add/Edit/Delete/View Users.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>There
      are two types of users in vtiger CRM software, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Users</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Administrator users</span>. <br>
    <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Users</span> can perform only
      CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) operations on records such
      as, leads, accounts, contacts, potentials, trouble tickets, and
      others. Where as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrators</span> can manage the complete software that includes, managing users/groups &amp; their access privileges, customizing vtiger CRM user interface,
      creating communications templates and configuring all organization wide
      settings.&nbsp; In general Standard Users will not have access to the
      Settings Panel and only Admin Users will have access to the Settings
      Panel<br>
    <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">How to create a Administrator User and
Standard User?</span></p>
<p>In
      the user creation screen there is a check box called <strong>Admin</strong>. When a user
      is created with selecting the <strong>Admin</strong> option then the user is an
      Administrator User and if the User is created without selecting  the
Admin option then the user is a Standard User.</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1">
  <tr>
    <td bordercolor="#003300"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each user created in the system must be associated with a ROLE</span></li>
          <li> Admin User will have all privileges in the organization</span></li>
          <li> Standard User's&nbsp; privilege will be defined by his&nbsp; Role</span></li>
        </ul></td>
  </tr>

<p>The other functions in User management are <span
 style="">Change Password, Deactivate Users, List
    Mail Server, Home Page Order, and View Login History.</span></p>

<h2><span
 style="">  <a name="Roles" id="Roles"></a>3. Roles</span></h2>
<p><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>The
      organization level hierarchy can be defined using Roles. Roles control
      the visibility level that users have in the organization&#8217;s
      data. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Users at any given role level
      can always view, edit, delete&nbsp; all data owned by users below them
      in the hierarchy </span>. For example, the Sales Manger can access/edit/delete all the
      Sales Reps' records because they are in the higher hierarchical level
      in
      the role tree. The Sales Reps can access only their records. <br>
    <br>
<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roles </span>in user management facilitate
      to Add/Edit/Delete/View Roles. Multiple profile support is available in
  roles i.e. a role can consists of one or more number of profiles.</p>

<h2><a name="Profiles" id="Profiles"></a>4. Profiles</span></h2>
<p>Profile
      function provides access to vtiger CRM modules (tabs), standard
      actions, utility actions , fields in various modules and global
      permissions. Users associated to the specific profile can access the
functions that are assigned to them.</p>
<p>Profiles defines the access privileges for the
following:</span></p>
<h3> <a name="Global_Privileges" id="Global_Privileges"></a>4.1.
 Global Privileges</h3>
<p>Global Privileges define the global permissions for
 all modules and all actions. Global Privileges consists of :</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>View all</strong>: can view
     all&nbsp; module data in the organization</li>
  <li> <strong>Edit all</strong>: can create/edit all module data in the organization</li>
</ul>
<h3>    <a
 name="Tab_Privileges" id="Tab_Privileges"></a>4.2.
  Tab Privileges</h3>
<p>Tab Privileges define the module tab level access
 for the following modules:</p>
<p>  Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Potentials,
      Dashboards, Activities, Trouble Tickets, FAQ, Calendar, Price Books,
      Purchase Orders,&nbsp; Invoices, Reports, Notes, Emails, Products,

        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Global Privileges in Profiles override the permissions defined by Tab, Standard, Utility and Field Privileges.&nbsp; </span>For example, in a profile the access for Potentials tab is denied via Tab Privileges. Even then the Profile User can view the Potentials module data if the 'View all'&nbsp; permission is allowed in the global privileges of that profile.</li>
          <li> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Privileges defined in the profile apply to only non-admin users. For admin users the permissions defined in profile is immaterial.</span></li>
          <li><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Profiles override the Default Organization Sharing Rules and the User defined Sharing Rules.&nbsp; </span>For example consider that the organization sharing rule allows an user to view the Potentials of other users. But the user cannot view the Potentials module because his profile does not allow him to access the Potential module.</li>
